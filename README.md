# Rastar
A web based system for authoring and displaying visual and audio sequences using canvas and web-audio API.

My original intent with this system was to make an animation system for authoring separate frames of animation using just raster images but it may turn out to be more than that.  It's possible I could turn this into an alternative to Flash.

Client side:
- Authoring GUI
- play engine

Server side:
- Authoring companion to the GUI that initially will just save model files and rendered frames to the file system.

Those rendered frames can be any resolution and the can end up being imported together with a simultaniously rendered sound file into Premiere Pro as a sequence and exported in any way you like.

The play engine will be included in a web page and can be bundled together with one or more animation model files as well as a possible model for playing a looping sequence of animations for advertizing just like Flash is used.

Just some initial ideas.
